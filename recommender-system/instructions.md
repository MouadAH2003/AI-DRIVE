1. Define Problem: Clearly state the goal of creating a recommender systemâ€”to suggest suitable vehicles to customers based on their preferences and previous rentals.

2. Gather Data: Collect information about user preferences (e.g., vehicle type, brand preference) and historical rental records. Consider methods like surveys, 
clickstream analysis, or A/B testing to obtain this data.

3. Choose Algorithm: Select a recommendation algorithm that suits your requirements. Some popular options include Collaborative Filtering (CF), Content-Based Filtering (CBF),
 Hybrid Filtering, Matrix Factorization, etc..

4. Implement Algorithm: Integrate the selected algorithm into your web application. Depending on the complexity of the algorithm, you might write custom code 
or utilize existing libraries such as Apache Mahout, Surprise, or LightFM.

5. Test & Refine: Evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of the recommender system through various tests. Use techniques like cross-validation, precision@k, recall@k, 
mean average precision (MAP), normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG), or other evaluation measures depending on your choice of algorithm. Based on the results, 
fine-tune the parameters and adjustments required to enhance the quality of recommendations.

6. Monitor & Update: Continuously track the performance of the recommender system over time. Keep updating the model with new data to maintain relevance and accuracy.
Regularly analyze the logs and user feedback to identify areas requiring improvement and incorporate those changes accordingly.
