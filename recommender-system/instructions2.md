1. Define the Data Schema: Start by defining the data schema for user profiles and item profiles (cars). Determine the attributes and features that will be relevant for building the recommender system, such as user preferences, rental history, car specifications, and features.
2. Collect or Generate Sample Data: To begin the modeling process, you'll need sample data to work with. If you have access to real user data and car specifications from a previous project or publicly available dataset, use that. If not, you can generate synthetic data to simulate user preferences, rental history, and car details.
3. Data Wrangling and Exploration: Once you have the sample data, spend some time exploring and wrangling it to ensure it's in a suitable format for building the recommender system. This may involve handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and performing any necessary data transformations.
4. Research Recommendation Algorithms: Explore different recommendation algorithms, such as collaborative filtering (user-based or item-based), content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches. Research the pros and cons of each algorithm and determine which one(s) might be best suited for your project based on the available data and requirements.
5. Design the Recommendation Pipeline: Start designing the end-to-end pipeline for the recommender system. This should include data preprocessing steps, feature engineering, model training (e.g., matrix factorization techniques for collaborative filtering, similarity measures for content-based filtering), and serving recommendations.
6. Evaluation Metrics and Validation Strategies: Determine appropriate evaluation metrics for assessing the recommender system's performance, such as precision, recall, RMSE, or other relevant metrics. Additionally, plan the validation strategies you'll use, such as train-test split, cross-validation, or user studies (if possible).
7. Document Your Work: As you progress through these steps, document your work thoroughly in the docs/ folder within the recommender-system directory. This should include design documents, architecture diagrams, rationale for your decisions, anticipated challenges, and any other relevant information.
Commit and Push Changes: Regularly commit your changes to the local branch (e.g., recommender-system) and push them to the remote repository. This will ensure that your work is backed up and accessible from anywhere.
